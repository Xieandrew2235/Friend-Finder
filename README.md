# Assignment: Friend Finder
<hr>
<strong>Description: </strong> Friend Finder was Tinder before Tinder, and just like every great thing in this world, it was overtaken by Tinder upon its creation. However, fear not, as we have devoted our resources to revive Friend Finder, and now you can find your perfect match!

## Instructions
<hr>

1. For this app, we will need two NPM packages. Navigate over to the Bamazon folder in your terminal, and type in your command line:

    * npm install body-parser
    * npm install express
    * npm install path

2. Upon arriving to our root page, you will be given a short introduction, along with a button "Go to survey", which will need to be pressed to continue on with our survey. Once you enter the survey page, you will be asked to provide your name, along with a URL to your picture.

3. You are then presented with a survey with 10 questions that require an answer from a scale of 1-5, with 1 being "strongly disagree" and 5 being "strongly agree".

4. After completing all 10 questions, Friend Finder will do its thing and match you up with the person who you should be most compatible with!
